    <abstract>
      <t> This document presents an extension to the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol 
      for the purpose of a group key management. The protocol is in conformance with the
      Multicast Security (MSEC) key management architecture, which contains
      two components: member registration and group rekeying. Both components
      require a Group Controller/Key Server to download IPsec group security
      associations to authorized members of a group. The group members then
      exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets. This
      document obsoletes RFC 6407. This documents also updates RFC 7296 by
      renaming one of transform types defined there.</t>

    <section title="Introduction and Overview">
      <t> This document presents an extension to IKEv2
      <xref target="RFC7296"></xref> called G-IKEv2, which allows performing a group key
      management. A group key management protocol provides IPsec keys and policy to a
      set of IPsec devices which are authorized to communicate using a Group
      Security Association (GSA) defined in <xref target="RFC3740"></xref>.
      The data communications within the group (e.g., IP multicast packets)
      are protected by a key pushed to the group members (GMs) by the Group
      Controller/Key Server (GCKS). </t>

      <t>G-IKEv2 conforms to the Multicast Group Security
      Architecture <xref target="RFC3740"></xref>, Multicast Extensions to the
      Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol <xref target="RFC5374"></xref>
      and the Multicast Security (MSEC) Group Key Management Architecture <xref target="RFC4046"></xref>.
      G-IKEv2 replaces GDOI <xref target="RFC6407"></xref>, which defines a
      similar group key management protocol using IKEv1 <xref
      target="RFC2409"></xref> (since deprecated by IKEv2). When G-IKEv2 is
      used, group key management use cases can benefit from the simplicity,
      increased robustness and cryptographic improvements of IKEv2 (see
      Appendix A of <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>).</t>

      <t>With G-IKEv2 a GM begins a "registration" exchange when it first joins the group.
      The GCKS authenticates and authorizes GMs, then pushes
      policy and keys used by the group to the GM. G-IKEv2 includes two
      "registration" exchanges. The first is the GSA_AUTH exchange (<xref target="gsa_auth" />), 
      which is used when a GM first contacts a GCKS and is creating an IKE SA between itself and the GCKS. 
      The second is the GSA_REGISTRATION exchange (<xref target="gsa_registration" />), 
      which a GM can use within the already established IKE SA. Group rekeys are accomplished using either 
      the GSA_REKEY pseudo-exchange (a single message distributed to all GMs, usually as
      a multicast message), or as a GSA_INBAND_REKEY exchange delivered
      individually to group members using their individual IKE SA).</t>

      <t>Large and small groups may use different sets of these protocols.
      When a large group of devices are communicating, the GCKS is likely to
      use the GSA_REKEY message for efficiency. This is shown in <xref
      target="large-groups"></xref>, where multicast communications indicated with doulle line. 
      (Note: For clarity, IKE_SA_INIT is omitted from <xref target="large-groups" /> and <xref target="small-groups" />).</t>

      <t>Alternatively, a small group may simply use the GSA_AUTH or GSA_REGISTRATION as
      registration protocols, where the GCKS issues rekeys using the
      GSA_INBAND_REKEY within the same IKE SA.

      <t> A combination of these approaches is also possible. For example,  
      the GCKS may use more robust GSA_INBAND_REKEY to provide keys for some GMs 
      (for example, those acting as senders in the group) and GSA_REKEY for the rest.
      Note also, that GCKS may also be a GM (as shown in <xref target="small-groups"></xref>).
      </t>

      <t>IKEv2 message semantics are preserved in that all communications
      consists of message request-response pairs. The exception to this rule
      is the GSA_REKEY pseudo-exchange, which is a single message delivering group
      updates to the GMs.</t>

        <t>G-IKEv2 is an extension to IKEv2 that <!-- uses its security mechanisms (peer authentication,
        confidentiality, message integrity) to ensure that only authenticated and authorized 
        devices have access to the group policy and keys. 
        G-IKEv2 --> provides group authorizatiom, secure policy and keys download from the GCKS to GMs. 
        </t>

        <t>G-IKEv2 is compatible with most IKEv2 extensions defined so far and it is believed that 
        future IKEv2 extensions will also be possible to use with G-IKEv2. However some IKEv2 extensions require 
        special handling if used with G-IKEv2. See <xref target="ike_ext" /> for more details.</t>
  
        <t>It is assumed that readers are familiar with the IKEv2 protocol, so
        this document skips many details that are described in <xref
        target="RFC7296"></xref>.</t>
  
        <section title="G-IKEv2 Transport and Port">
          <t> As IKEv2 extension G-IKEv2 <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the IKEv2 ports (500, 4500). 
          G-IKEv2 <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also use TCP transport for registration (unicast) IKE SA, 
          as defined in <xref target="RFC9329" />.
          G-IKEv2 <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also use UDP port 848, the same as GDOI <xref
          target="RFC6407"></xref>, because they serve a similar function. 
          The version number in the IKE header distinguishes the G-IKEv2
          protocol from GDOI protocol <xref target="RFC6407"></xref>. 
          </t>

          <t>Section 2.23 of <xref target="RFC7296" /> describes how IKEv2 supports paths with NATs.
          Despite the fact, that with G-IKEv2 the registration SA doesn't create any unicast IPsec SAs and thus 
          there is no unicast ESP traffic between the GM and the GCKS to encapsulate in UDP if NAT is present, 
          the actions described in this section concerned with the IKE SA <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be honored. 
          The behavior of GMs and GCKS <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> depend on the port used to create the initial IKE SA.
          For exmaple, if the GM and the GCKS used UDP port 848 for the IKE_SA_INIT exchange, they
          will operate the same as if they had used UDP port 500.

      </section>

      <section title="G-IKEv2 Member Registration and Secure Channel Establishment" anchor="registration">
        <t>The registration protocol consists of a minimum of two 
        exchanges, IKE_SA_INIT and GSA_AUTH; member registration may have a
        few more messages exchanged if the EAP method, cookie challenge (for
        DoS protection), negotiation of Diffie-Hellman group or IKEv2 extensions 
        based on <xref target="RFC9242" /> 
        are used. Each exchange consists of request/response pairs. The first exchange
        IKE_SA_INIT is defined in IKEv2 <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>. This
        exchange negotiates cryptographic algorithms, exchanges nonces and
        computes a shared key between the GM and the GCKS.</t>

        <t>The second exchange GSA_AUTH is similar to the IKEv2 IKE_AUTH exchange <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>.
        It authenticates the previously exchanged messages, exchanges identities and certificates. 
        The GSA_AUTH messages are encrypted and integrity protected with keys established through the previous
        exchanges, so the identities are hidden from eavesdroppers and all
        fields in all the messages are authenticated. The GCKS authorizes
        group members to be allowed into the group as part of the
        GSA_AUTH exchange. Once the GCKS accepts a GM to join a
        group it will provide the GM with the data security keys (TEKs) and/or group key
        encrypting key (KEK) as part of the GSA_AUTH response message. </t>

        <section anchor="gsa_auth" title="GSA_AUTH exchange">
          <t>After the group member and GCKS negotiate cryptographic algorithms, exchange nonces, 
          and compute shared keys as defined in IKEv2 <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>, 
          the GSA_AUTH exchange <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> complete before any other exchanges defined in this document 
          can be done. GSA_AUTH is used to authenticate the previous exchanges,
          exchange identities and certificates. G-IKEv2 also uses this
          exchange for group member registration and authorization.
          </t>

          <t> The GSA_AUTH exchange is similar to the IKE_AUTH exchange with the 
          difference that its goal is to establish multicast Data-Security SAs
          and optionally provide GM with the keys for Rekey SA. The set of payloads 
          in the GSA_AUTH exchange is slightly different, because policy is not
          negotiated between the group member and the GCKS, but instead
          provided by the GCKS for the GM. Note also, that GSA_AUTH 
          has its own exchange type, which is different from the IKE_AUTH exchange type.
          </t>

          <t>Note, that due to the similarities between IKE_AUTH and GSA_AUTH,
          most IKEv2 extensions to the IKE_AUTH exchange 
          (like <xref target="RFC6467" />) can also be used with the GSA_AUTH exchange.

          <t> The GCKS responds with IDr, optional CERT, and AUTH payloads 
          with the same meaning as in IKE_AUTH. It also informs the group member
          of the cryptographic policies of the group in the GSA payload and
          the key material in the KD payload. 

          <!-- XXXX Do we need the following? It looks useless.
          The GM which wants to join the group will not have any policy, 
          and in any case even if it has, the policy will be replaces while it joins. --> 

          <!-- The GCKS can also include a
          Delete (D) payload instructing the group member to delete existing
          SAs it might have as the result of a previous group member registration 
          Note, that since the GCKS generally doesn't know which 
          SAs the GM has, the SPI field in the Delete payload(s) SHOULD be set to zero
          in this case. (See more discussion on the Delete payload in <xref

          etc. In these cases, see <xref target="notify"></xref>, the GSA_AUTH
          response will not include the GSA and KD, but will include a Notify
          payload indicating errors. If a GM included an SAg
          payload, and the GCKS chooses to evaluate it, and the GCKS detects that
          the group member cannot support the security policy defined for the
          group, then the GCKS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> return a NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN.

        <section title="GM Registration Operations">
          <t>A GM requesting registration contacts the
          GCKS using the IKE_SA_INIT exchange and receives the response from
          the GCKS. This exchange is unchanged from the IKE_SA_INIT in IKEv2
          protocol. The IKE_SA_INIT exchange may optionally be followed 
          by one or more the IKE_INTERMEDIATE <xref target="RFC9242" /> exchanges if the GM and the GCKS
          negotiated using IKEv2 extensions based on this exchange.
          </t>

          <t>Next the GM sends the GSA_AUTH request message with the IKEv2 payloads
          from IKE_AUTH (without the SAi2, TSi and TSr payloads) along with
          the Group ID informing the GCKS of the group the initiator wishes to
          join. An initiator intending to emit data traffic <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> send a
          SENDER Notify payload status. The SENDER notification not only signifies that it
          is a sender, but provides the initiator the ability to request
          Sender-ID values, in case the Data-Security SA supports a counter
          mode cipher. <xref target="counter-modes"></xref>) includes guidance
          on requesting Sender-ID values.</t>

          <t>A GM may be limited in the types of Transforms that it is
          able or willing to use, and may find it useful to inform the GCKS
          which Transforms it is willing to accept for different security protocols
          by including the SAg payload into the request message.
          Proposals for Rekey SA (with protocol GIKE_REKEY) and for Data-Security 
          (AH <xref target="RFC4302" /> and/or ESP <xref target="RFC4303" />) SAs 
          may be included into SAg. Each Proposal contains a list of Transforms that the GM is able 
          and willing to support for that protocol. Valid transform types depend on the 
          protocol (AH, ESP, GIKE_REKEY) and are defined in <xref target="allowed_transforms" />.
          Other transform types <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> be included.
          The SPI length of each Proposal in an SAg is set to zero, and thus the SPI field is empty. 
          The GCKS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> ignore SPI length and SPI fields in the SAg payload. 
          </t>
          
          <t>Generally, a single Proposal of each 
          type will suffice, because the group member is not negotiating Transform sets, 
          simply alerting the GCKS to restrictions it may have.
          In particular, the restriction from Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC7296" /> that 
          AEAD and non-AEAD transforms must not be combined in a single proposal
          doesn't hold when the SAg payload is being formed. However 
          if the GM has restrictions on combination of algorithms,
          this can be expressed by sending several proposals.</t>

          <t>Proposal Num field in Proposal substructure is treated specially in SAg payload:
          it allows a GM to indicate that algorithms used in Rekey SA and in 
          Data-Security (AH and/or ESP) SAs are dependent.
          In particular, Proposals of different types having the same value in
          Proposal Num field are treated as a set, so that if GCKS uses transforms
          from one of such Proposal for one protocol, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only use transforms from 
          one of the Proposals with the same value in Proposal Num field for other protocols.
          For example, a GM may support algorithms X and Y for both Rekey and
          Data-Security SAs, but with a restriction that if X is used in Rekey SA, then only X can be used
          in Data-Security SAs, and the same for Y. 
          To indicate this the GM sends several Proposals marking those of them that must be used in conjunction
          by putting the same value in their Proposal Num field. 
          In the simplest case when no dependency between transforms exists,
          all Proposals in SAg payload will have the same value in Proposal Num field.
          </t>

          <t>Although the SAg payload is optional, it is <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> for the GM to include
          this payload into the GSA_AUTH request to allow the GCKS to select an appropriate policy.
          </t>
          
          <t>A GM MAY also indicate the support for IPcomp by inclusion one or more the IPCOMP_SUPPORTED
          notifications along with the SAg payload. The CPI in these notifications is set to zero
          and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored by the GCKS.
          </t>

          <t>Upon receiving the GSA_AUTH response, the initiator parses the
          response from the GCKS authenticating the exchange using the IKEv2
          method, then processes the GSA and KD payloads.</t>

          <t>The GSA payload contains the security policy and cryptographic
          protocols used by the group. This policy describes the optional Rekey SA
          (KEK), Data-security SAs (TEK), and optional Group Associated policy
          (GAP). If the policy in the GSA payload is not acceptable to the GM,
          it <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> notify the GCKS by initiating a GSA_REGISTRATION exchange 
          with a NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN Notify payload (see <xref target="gsa_registration"></xref>). 
          Note, that this should normally not happen if the GM includes SAg payload 
          in the GSA_AUTH request and the GCKS takes it into account.
          Finally the KD payload is parsed providing the keying material for the TEK and/or KEK. 
          The KD payload contains a list of key packets, where each key packet includes the
          keying material for SAs distributed in the GSA payload. Keying
          material is matched by comparing the SPIs in the key packets to SPIs
          previously included in the GSA payloads. Once TEK keys and policy
          are matched, the GM provides them to the data security subsystem,
          and it is ready to send or receive packets matching the TEK
          policy.</t>

          <t>The GSA KEK policy <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the attribute GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID with
          a first Message ID the GM should expect to receive if it is non-zero.
          The value of the attribute <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be checked by a GM against any previously received Message ID for this group.
          If it is less than the previously received number, it should be
          considered stale and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be ignored. This could happen if two GSA_AUTH
          exchanges happened in parallel, and the Message ID changed. This
          attribute is used by the GM to prevent GSA_REKEY message replay
          attacks. The first GSA_REKEY message that the GM receives from the
          GCKS must have a Message ID greater or equal to the Message ID
          received in the GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID attribute.</t>

          <t>Once a GM successfully registers to the group it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> replace
          any information related to this group (policy, keys) that it might
          have as a result of a previous registration with a new one.
          </t>

          <t>Once a GM has received GIKE_REKEY policy during a registration the IKE SA
          may be closed. However, the GM <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> close IKE SA, it is the GCKS
          who makes the decision whether to close or keep it, because depending on the policy 
          the IKE SA may be used for inband rekeying for small groups.
          If inband rekeying is used, then the initial IKE SA is rekeyed (when necessary)
          via standard IKEv2 mechanism described in Section 1.3.2 of <xref target="RFC7296" />. 
          If for some reason this SA is teared down and no GIKE_REKEY policy was received during the registration process, 
          the GM <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> consider itself excluded from the group. To continue participating
          in the group the GM should re-register.

        <section title="GCKS Registration Operations">
          <t>A G-IKEv2 GCKS passively listens for incoming requests from group
          members. When the GCKS receives an IKE_SA_INIT request, it selects
          an IKE proposal and generates a nonce and DH to include them in the
          IKE_SA_INIT response.</t>

          <t>Upon receiving the GSA_AUTH request, the GCKS authenticates the
          group member via the GSA_AUTH exchange. The
          GCKS then authorizes the group member according to group policy
          before preparing to send the GSA_AUTH response. If the GCKS fails to
          authorize the GM, it will respond with an AUTHORIZATION_FAILED
          notify message. The GCKS may also respond with an INVALID_GROUP_ID notify message
          if the requested group is unknown to the GCKS or with an REGISTRATION_FAILED
          notify message if there is a problem with the requested group (for example
          the capacity of the group is exceeded).</t>

          <t>The GSA_AUTH response will include the group policy in the GSA
          payload and keys in the KD payload. If the GCKS policy includes a
          group rekey option, it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include the GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID attribute, 
          specifying the starting Message ID the GCKS will use when sending the GSA_REKEY message
          to the group members if this Message ID is non-zero. This Message ID is used to prevent GSA_REKEY 
          message replay attacks and will be increased each time a GSA_REKEY message is sent
          to the group. The GCKS data traffic policy is included in the GSA
          TEK and keys are included in the KD TEK. The GAP <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> also be
          included to provide the ATD and/or DTD (<xref target="gap_attr_atd_dtd"></xref>) 
          specifying activation and deactivation
          delays for SAs generated from the TEKs. If the group member has
          indicated that it is a sender of data traffic and one or more Data
          Security SAs distributed in the GSA payload included a counter mode
          of operation, the GCKS responds with one or more Sender-ID values (see <xref
          target="counter-modes"></xref>).</t>

          <t><xref target="RFC5374" /> defines two modes of operation for multicast 
          Data-Security SAs: transport mode and tunnel mode with address preservation.
          In the latter case outer source and destination addresses are taken from
          the inner IP packet.
          </t>

          <t>If the GCKS receives a GSA_REGISTRATION exchange with a request
          to register a GM to a group, the GCKS will need to authorize the GM
          with the new group (IDg) and respond with the corresponding group
          policy and keys. If the GCKS fails to authorize the GM, it will
          respond with the AUTHORIZATION_FAILED notification. The GCKS may also 
          respond with an INVALID_GROUP_ID or REGISTRATION_FAILED notify messages 
          for the reasons described above.</t>

          <t>If a group member includes an SAg in its GSA_AUTH or
          GSA_REGISTRATION request, the GCKS may evaluate it according to an
          implementation specific policy.
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>The GCKS could evaluate the list of Transforms and compare it
              to its current policy for the group. If the group member did not
              include all of the ESP, AH or GIKE_REKEY Transforms that match the current group policy
              or the capabilities of all other currently active GMs, 
              then the GCKS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> return a NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN Notification.</t>

              <t>The GCKS could store the list of Transforms, with the goal of
              migrating the group policy to a different Transforms when all of
              the group members indicate that they can support that
              Transforms.</t>

              <t>The GCKS could store the list of Transforms and adjust the
              current group policy based on the capabilities of the devices as
              long as they fall within the acceptable security policy of the
              GCKS.</t>
            </list>
          Depending on its policy, the GCKS may have no need for the
          IKE SA (e.g., it does not plan to initiate an GSA_INBAND_REKEY
          exchange). If the GM does not initiate another registration exchange
          or Notify (e.g., NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN), and also does not close the
          IKE SA and the GCKS is not intended to use the SA, then after a
          short period of time the GCKS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> close the IKE SA.</t>

      <section title="Group Maintenance Channel">
        <t>The GCKS is responsible for rekeying the secure group per the group
        policy. Rekeying is an operation whereby the GCKS provides replacement
        TEKs and KEK, deleting TEKs, and/or excluding group members. The GCKS
        may initiate a rekey message if group membership and/or policy has
        changed, or if the keys are about to expire. Two forms of group
        maintenance channels are provided in G-IKEv2 to push new policy to

          a real IKEv2 exchange, since no response messages are sent. --> This method is
          valuable for large and dynamic groups, and where policy may change

          GSA_REKEY is used, the IKE SA protecting the member
          registration exchanges is usually terminated, and group members await
          policy changes from the GCKS via the GSA_REKEY messages.</t>

          <t hangText="GSA_INBAND_REKEY">The GSA_INBAND_REKEY is a
          normal IKEv2 exchange using the IKE SA that was setup to protecting the
          member registration exchange. This exchange allows the GCKS to
          rekey without using an independent GSA_REKEY pseudo-exchange. The
          GSA_INBAND_REKEY exchange provides a reliable policy delivery and 
          is useful when G-IKEv2 is used with a small group of cooperating devices.</t>
        </list>

        Depending on its policy the GCKS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> combine these two methods.
        For example, it may use the GSA_INBAND_REKEY to deliver key to the 
        GMs in the group acting as senders (as this would provide reliable keys delivery), 
        and the GSA_REKEY for the rest GMs.

          <t>The GSA payload contains the current policy for rekey and Data-Security SAs.

          message if the authentication method is based on public key signatures
          <!-- or a dedicated shared secret --> and <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be included if authentication is implicit.
          In the latter case, the fact that a GM can decrypt the GSA_REKEY message and verify its ICV 
          proves that the sender of this message knows the current KEK,
          thus authenticating the sender as a member of the group. 
          <!-- Shared secret and --> Note, that implicit authentication doesn't provide source origin authentication.
          For this reason using implicit authentication for GSA_REKEY is <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14> 
          unless source origin authentication is not required (for example, in a small group of
          highly trusted GMs). The value of the Auth Method field in the AUTH payload 
          in the GSA_REKEY message <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be NULL Authentication.</t>
        
          <t> During group member registration, the GCKS
          sends the authentication key in the KD payload, AUTH_KEY attribute, 
          which the group member uses to authenticate the key
          server. Before the current Authentication Key expires, the GCKS will
          send a new AUTH_KEY to the group members in a GSA_REKEY message.
          The AUTH key that is sent in the rekey message may be not the same
          as the authentication key sent during the GM registration. If implicit authentication
          is used, then AUTH_KEY <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be sent to GMs.</t>

            <t>The content of the AUTH payload depends on the authentication method and is either
            a digital signature or a result of prf applied to the content of the not yet encrypted GSA_REKEY message.
            </t>

            <t>The authentication algorithm (prf or digital signing) is applied to the concatenation of two chunks: A and P. 
            The chunk A lasts from the first octet of the G-IKEv2 header (not including prepended four octets of zeros, if port 4500 is used) 
            to the last octet of the Encrypted Payload header. The chunk P consists of the not yet encrypted content of the Encrypted payload, excluding 
            the Initialization Vector, the Padding, the Pad Length and the Integrity Checksum Data fields (see 3.14 of <xref target="RFC7296" /> for description 
            of the Encrypted payload). In other words, the P chunk is the inner payloads of the Encrypted payload in plaintext form. 
            <xref target="auth_data" /> illustrates the layout of the P and A chunks in the GSA_REKEY message.
            </t>

            <t>Before the AUTH payload calculation the inner payloads of Encrypted payload must be 
            fully formed and ready for encryption except for the AUTH payload.
            The AUTH payload must have correct values in the Payload Header, the Auth Method and the RESERVED fields.
            The Authentication Data field is zeroed, but if Digital Signature authentication 
            method is in use, then the ASN.1 Length and the AlgorithmIdentifier fields must be properly filled in, see <xref target="RFC7427" />. 
            </t>

            <t>For the purpose of the AUTH payload calculation the Length field in the IKE header and the Payload Length 
            field in the Encrypted Payload header are adjusted so that they don't count the lengths
            of Initialization Vector, Integrity Checksum Data and Padding (along with Pad Length field).
            In other words, the Length field in the IKE header (denoted as AdjustedLen in  
            <xref target="auth_data" /> ) is set to the sum of the lengths of A and P, and the Payload Length
            field in the Encrypted Payload header (denoted as AdjustedPldLen in 
            <xref target="auth_data" />) is set to the length of P plus the size of the Payload header (four octets).

            The GSA, KD, N and D payloads follow with the

            <t>Because GSA_REKEY messages are not acknowledged and could be
            discarded by the network, one or more GMs may not receive 
            the new policy. To mitigate such lost messages, during a rekey event the
            GCKS may transmit several copies of an encrypted GSA_REKEY message with the new
            policy. The retransmitted messages <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be bitwise identical and <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be

            <t>When a group member receives the Rekey Message from the GCKS it
            decrypts the message using the current KEK, validates its authenticity
            using the key retrieved in a previous G-IKEv2 exchange if AUTH payload is present, 
            verifies the Message ID, and processes the GSA and KD
            payloads. The group member then downloads the new Data-Security SA
            and/or new Rekey SA. The parsing of the payloads is identical to
            the parsing done in the registration exchange.</t>

            <t>Replay protection is achieved by a group member rejecting a
            GSA_REKEY message which has a Message ID smaller than the current
            Message ID that the GM is expecting. The GM expects the Message ID
            in the first GSA_REKEY message it receives to be equal or greater
            than the Message ID it receives in the GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID attribute.
            Note, that if the GSA_INITIAL_MESSAGE_ID attribute is not received for the Rekey SA, 
            the GM <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> assume zero as the first expected Message ID.
            The GM expects the Message ID in subsequent GSA_REKEY messages to
            be greater than the last valid GSA_REKEY message ID it
            received.</t>

            <t>> GSA_REKEY messages are sent infrequently (typically one per several hours or,
            in extreme cases, several minutes), which is much greater than typical
            network packet reordering intervals.
            </t>

            <t>If the GSA payload includes a Data-Security SA using cipher in a
            counter-modes of operation and the receiving group member is a
            sender for that SA, the group member uses its current Sender-ID value
            with the Data-Security SAs to create counter-mode nonces. If it is
            a sender and does not hold a current Sender-ID value, it <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>
            install the Data-Security SAs. It <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> initiate a GSA_REGISTRATION
            exchange to the GCKS in order to obtain an Sender-ID value (along with
            the current group policy).</t>

            <t>Once a new Rekey SA is installed as a result of GSA_REKEY
            message, the current Rekey SA (over which the message was received)
            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be silently deleted after waiting DEACTIVATION_TIME_DELAY interval 
            regardless of its expiration time. If the message includes Delete payload
            for existing Data-security SA, then after installing a new Data-Security SA the old one, 
            identified by the Protocol and SPI fields in the Delete payload, <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be silently deleted 
            after waiting DEACTIVATION_TIME_DELAY interval regardless of its expiration time.

            initiate a registration to the GCKS. This registration serves as a

          <t>The GCKS <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> specify the remaining active time of the

          be omitted from the message.

          <t>There may be circumstances where the GCKS may want to start over 
          with a clean state, for example in case it runs out of available Sender-IDs. 
          The GCKS can signal deletion of all the Data-security SAs by
          sending a Delete payload with an SPI value equal to zero.
          For example, if the GCKS wishes to remove the Rekey SA and all the
          Data-security SAs, the GCKS sends a Delete payload with an SPI
          of zero and Protocol ID of AH or ESP, followed by another Delete payload

      <section anchor="counter-modes" title="Counter-based modes of operation">
        <t>Several counter-based modes of operation have been specified
        for ESP (e.g., AES-CTR <xref target="RFC3686"></xref>, AES-GCM <xref
        target="RFC4106"></xref>, AES-CCM <xref target="RFC4309"></xref>,
        ChaCha20-Poly1305 <xref target="RFC7634"></xref>,
        AES-GMAC <xref target="RFC4543"></xref>) and AH (e.g., AES-GMAC <xref
        target="RFC4543"></xref>). These counter-based modes require that no
        two senders in the group ever send a packet with the same
        Initialization Vector (IV) using the same cipher key and mode. This
        requirement is met in G-IKEv2 when the following requirements are
        met:
        <list style="symbols">

        <t>The GCKS distributes a unique key for each Data-Security SA.</t>

        <t>The GCKS uses the method described in <xref target="RFC6054"></xref>, 
        which assigns each sender a portion of the IV space by provisioning each 
        sender with one or more unique Sender-ID values.</t>

        </list></t>

        <section title="Allocation of Sender-ID">
          <t>When at least one Data-Security SA included in the group policy
          includes a counter-based mode of operation, the GCKS automatically
          allocates and distributes one Sender-ID to each group member acting in the
          role of sender on the Data-Security SA. The Sender-ID value is used
          exclusively by the group sender to which it was allocated. The group
          sender uses the same Sender-ID for each Data-Security SA specifying the
          use of a counter-based mode of operation. A GCKS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> distribute
          unique keys for each Data-Security SA including a counter-based mode
          of operation in order to maintain unique key and nonce usage.</t>

          <t>During registration, the group sender can choose to request one
          or more Sender-ID values. Requesting a value of 1 is not necessary since
          the GCKS will automatically allocate exactly one to the group
          sender. A group sender <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> request as many Sender-ID values matching the number
          of encryption modules in which it will be installing the TEKs in the
          outbound direction. Alternatively, a group sender <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> request more
          than one Sender-ID and use them serially. This could be useful when it is
          anticipated that the group sender will exhaust their range of Data-
          Security SA nonces using a single Sender-ID too quickly (e.g., before the
          time-based policy in the TEK expires).</t>

          <t>When the group policy includes a counter-based mode of operation,
          a GCKS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use the following method to allocate Sender-ID values, which
          ensures that each Sender-ID will be allocated to just one group
          sender.<list style="numbers">

          <t>A GCKS maintains an Sender-ID counter, which records the Sender-IDs that
          have been allocated. Sender-IDs are allocated sequentially, with zero as
          the first allocated value.</t>

          <t>Each time an Sender-ID is allocated, the current value of the
          counter is saved and allocated to the group sender. The Sender-ID counter
          is then incremented in preparation for the next allocation.</t>

          <t>When the GCKS specifies a counter-based mode of operation in
          the Data-Security SA a group sender may request a count of Sender-IDs 
          during registration in a Notify payload information of type SENDER.
          When the GCKS receives this request, it increments the Sender-ID counter
          once for each requested Sender-ID, and distributes each Sender-ID value to the
          group sender. The GCKS <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> have a policy-defined upper bound for
          the number of Sender-ID values that it will return irrespective of the number
          requested by the GM.</t>

          <t>A GCKS allocates new Sender-ID values for each registration operation 
          by a group sender, regardless of whether the group
          sender had previously contacted the GCKS. In this way, the GCKS is
          not required to maintaining a record of which Sender-ID values it had
          previously allocated to each group sender. More importantly, since
          the GCKS cannot reliably detect whether the group sender had sent
          data on the current group Data-Security SAs it does not know what
          Data-Security counter-mode nonce values that a group sender has
          used. By distributing new Sender-ID values, the key server ensures that
          each time a conforming group sender installs a Data-Security SA it
          will use a unique set of counter-based mode nonces.</t>

          <t>When the Sender-ID counter maintained by the GCKS reaches its final
          Sender-ID value, no more Sender-ID values can be distributed. Before
          distributing any new Sender-ID values, the GCKS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> 
          exclude all group members from the group as described
          in <xref target="deletion" />. This will result in the group members 
          performing re-registration, during which they will receive new Data-Security SAs 
          and group senders will additionally receive new Sender-ID values.
          The new Sender-ID values can safely be used because they are only used with
          the new Data-Security SAs.</t>

      <section anchor="seqnum" title="Replay Protection for Multicast Data-Security SAs">
        <t>IPsec provides replay protection as part of its security services.
        With multicast extension for IPsec replay protection is not always possible to achieve 
        (see Section 6.1 of <xref target="RFC3740" />).
        In particular, if there are many group senders for a Data-Security SA, then
        each of them will independently increment the Sequence Number field in the ESP header
        (see Section 2 of <xref target="RFC4303" />) thus making it impossible for the 
        group receivers to filter out replayed packets. However, if there is only one
        group sender for a Data-Security SA, then it is possible to achieve replay protection
        with some restrictions (see <xref target="esn" />). The GCKS may create several Data-Security SAs 
        with the same traffic selectors allowing only a single group sender in each SA 
        if it is desirable to get replay protection with multiple (but still limited number) of group senders.
        </t>

        <t>IPsec architecture assumes that it is a local matter for an IPsec receiver whether 
        replay protection is active or not. In other words, an IPsec sender always increments
        the Sequence Number field in the ESP header and a receiver decides whether to check
        for replayed packets or not. With multicast extension for IPsec this approach generally 
        isn't applicable, since group members don't know how many group senders exist
        for a particular Data-Security SA. For this reason the status or replay protection must be 
        part of the policy downloaded to GMs by GCKS.
        </t>

        <t>For this purpose this specification re-uses the Extended Sequence Numbers transform,
        defined in Section 3.3.2 <xref target="RFC7296" />. This specification renames 
        this transform to "Replay Protection" and adds a new value for possible Transform IDs:
        "Not Used" (&lt;TBA by IANA&gt;). The GCKS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> include this transform in the GSA payload
        for every Data-Security SA. Note, that this specification prohibits using Extended
        Sequence Numbers (see <xref target="esn" />).

    <section anchor="key_management" title="Group Key Management and Access Control">
      <t>Through the G-IKEv2 rekey, G-IKEv2 supports algorithms such as
      Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) that have the property of denying access to a new group key by
      a member removed from the group (forward access control) and to an
      old group key by a member added to the group (backward access
      control). An unrelated notion to PFS, "forward access control" and
      "backward access control" have been called "perfect forward
      security" and "perfect backward security" in the literature <xref
      target="RFC2627"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Group management algorithms providing forward and backward
      access control other than LKH have been proposed in the

      Difference <xref target="NNL"></xref>. These algorithms could be
      used with G-IKEv2, but are not specified as a part of this
      document.</t>

      <t>The Group Key Management Method transform from the GSA 
      policy specifies how members of the group obtain group keys. 
      This document specifies a single method for the group key management -- 
      Wrapped Key Download. This method assumes that all group keys are
      sent to the GMs by the GCKS encrypted with some other keys,

        </t>

        <t>The GCKS may also send other keys to GMs that will be used as Key Wrap Keys
        for the purpose of building key hierarchy. Each KWK is associated

        SA with possibly different Encryption Algorithm transform.

        <t>To have an ability to provide forward access control the GCKS provides each GM

        <section title="Forward Access Control Requirements">
          <t>When group membership is altered using a group management
          algorithm new Data-Security SAs and their associated keys are usually
          also needed. New Data-Security SAs and keys ensure that members who were
          denied access can no longer participate in the group.</t>

          <t>If forward access control is a desired property of the group,
          new TEK policy and the associated keys <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be included 
          in a G-IKEv2 rekey message which changes group membership. 
          This is required because the GSA TEK policy
          and the associated keys are not protected with the new KEK. 
          A second G-IKEv2 rekey message can
          deliver the new GSA TEKS and their associated keys 
          because it will be protected with the new KEK, and thus will not
          be visible to the members who were denied access.</t>

          <t>If forward access control policy for the group includes
          keeping group policy changes from members that are denied access
          to the group, then two sequential G-IKEv2 rekey messages
          changing the group KEK <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent by the GCKS. The first
          G-IKEv2 rekey message creates a new KEK for the group. Group
          members, which are denied access, will not be able to access the
          new KEK, but will see the group policy since the G-IKEv2 rekey
          message is protected under the current KEK. A subsequent G-IKEv2
          rekey message containing the changed group policy and again
          changing the KEK allows complete forward access control. A
          G-IKEv2 rekey message <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> change the policy without
          creating a new KEK.</t>

          <t>If other methods of using LKH or other group management
          algorithms are added to G-IKEv2, those methods <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> remove the
          above restrictions requiring multiple G-IKEv2 rekey messages,
          providing those methods specify how the forward access control
          policy is maintained within a single G-IKEv2 rekey message.</t>

      <section anchor="keys_gm_semantics" title="GM Key Management Semantics">
        <t>This specification defines a GM Key Management semantics
        in such a way, that it doesn't depend on the key management
        method employed by the GCKS. This allows having all the complexity
        of key management in the GCKS, which is free to implement various
        key management methods, such as direct transmitting of group SA
        keys or using some kind of key hierarchy (e.g. LKH). 
        For all these policies the GM behavior is the same.
        </t>

        <t>Each key that a GM receives in G-IKEv2 is identified by a 32-bit number called Key ID.
        Zero Key ID has a special meaning -- it always contains keying material
        from which the keys for protecting Data-Security SAs and Rekey SA are taken.
        </t>

        <t>All keys in G-IKEv2 are transmitted in encrypted form, as specified 
        in <xref target="wrapped_key" />. This format includes a Key ID
        (ID of a key that is encrypted) and a KWK ID
        (ID of a key that was used to encrypt this key). Keys may be 
        encrypted either with default KWK (GSK_w) or with other keys,
        which the GM has received in the WRAP_KEY attributes.
        If a key was encrypted with GSK_w, then the KWK ID field is set to zero,
        otherwise the KWK ID field identifies the key used for encryption.
        </t>

        <t>When a GM receives a message from the GCKS installing new Data-Security or Rekey SA,
        it will contain a KD payload with an SA_KEY attribute containing keying material for this SA.
        For a Data-Security SA exactly one SA_KEY attribute will be present
        with both Key ID and KWK ID fields set to zero. This means that the 
        default KWK (GSK_w) should be used to extract this keying material.
        </t>

        <t>For a multicast Rekey SA multiple SA_KEY attributes may be present 
        depending on the key management method employed by the GCKS. If multiple SA_KEY attributes 
        are present then all of them <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> contain the same keying material encrypted using different KWKs.
        The GM in general is unaware of the GCKS's key management method and can always use the same procedure to get 
        the keys. In particular, the GM's task is to find a way to decrypt at least one of the SA_KEY attributes
        using either the GSK_w or the keys from the WRAP_KEY attributes that are present in the same message  
        or were receives in previous messages.
        </t>

        <t>We will use the term "Key Path" to describe an ordered sequence of keys 
        where each subsequent key was used to encrypt the previous one.
        The GM keeps its own Key Path (called Working Key Path) in the memory associated
        with each group it is registered to and updates it when needed.
        When the GSA_REKEY message is received the GM processes the received SA_KEY attributes 
        one by one trying to construct a new key path that starts from this attributes and 
        ends with any key in the Working Key Path or with the default KWK (GSK_w). 
        </t>

        <t>In the simplest case the SA_KEY attribute is encrypted
        with GSK_w so that the new Key Path is empty. 
        If more complex key management methods are used then a Key Path will
        contain intermediate keys from the WRAP_KEY attributes
        received by a GM so far starting from its registration to the group. If the GM is able 
        to construct a new Key Path using intermediate keys it has, then it is able to decrypt the SA_KEY attribute 
        and use its content to form new SA keys. If it is unable to build a new Key Path, then in means that the GM is excluded
        from the group.
        </t>

        <t>Depending on the new Key Path the GM should do the following actions to be prepared for future key updates:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>If the new Key Path is empty then no actions are needed. This may happen 
          if no WRAP_KEY attributes from the received message were used.
          </t>
          <t>If the new Key Path is non-empty and it ends with the default KWK (GSK_w), then the whole new 
          Key Path is stored by the GM as the GM's Working Key Path.
          This situation may only happen at the time the GM is registering to the group,
          when the GCKS is providing it with its personal key and the other keys from the key tree that are needed for this GM.
          These keys form an initial Working Key Path for this GM.
          </t>
          <t>In all other cases the new Key Path will end at some intermediate key from the GM's current Working Key Path. 
          In this case the new Key Path is constructed by replacing a part of the GM's current Working Key Path from the beginning and up to (but not including) 
          the key that the GM has used to decrypt the last key in the new Key Path.
          </t>

      <section anchor="group_sa_keys" title="SA Keys">
        <t>Keys used for Data-Security SAs or Rekey SA (called here SA keys) are downloaded to GMs in the form of keying material. 
        The keys for each algorithm employed in an SA are taken from this keying material as if they were concatenated to form it.
        </t>

        <t>For a Data-Security SA the keys are taken in accordance to the third bullet from Section 2.17 of 
        <xref target="RFC7296" />. In particular, for the ESP and AH SAs the encryption key (if any) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
        taken from the first bits of the keying material and the integrity key (if any) <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
        taken from the remaining bits.

        <t>For a Rekey SA the following keys are taken from the keying material:

        where GSK_e and GSK_a are the keys used for the Encryption Algorithm and the Integrity Algorithm transforms
        for the corresponding SA and GSK_w is a default KWK for this SA. Note, that GSK_w is also used with 
        the Encryption Algorithm transform as well as GSK_e. If an AEAD algorithm is used for encryption, 
        then SK_a key will not be used (GM can use the formula above assuming the length of SK_a is zero).

        <section anchor="group_policy" title="Group Policies">
          <t>Croup policies are comprised of two types of policy -- Group SA (GSA) policy
          and Group Associated (GA) policy. GSA policy defines parameters 
          for the Security Association for the group. Depending on the 
          employed security protocol GSA policies may further be classified as
          Rekey SA policy (GSA KEK) and Data-Security SA policy (GSA TEK).
          GSA payload may contain zero or one GSA KEK policy, zero or more GSA TEK policies, 
          and zero or one GA policy, where either one GSA KEK or GSA TEK policy <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be present.</t>

          <t>This latitude allows various group policies to be accommodated.
          For example if the group policy does not require the use of a Rekey
          SA, the GCKS would not need to send a GSA KEK policy to the group
          member since all SA updates would be performed using the GSA_INBAND_REKEY exchange via the 
          unicast IKE SA. Alternatively, group policy might use a Rekey SA
          but choose to download a KEK to the group member only as part of the
          unicast IKE SA. Therefore, the GSA KEK policy would not be
          necessary as part of the GSA_REKEY message.</t>

          <t>Specifying multiple GSA TEKs allows multiple related data streams
          (e.g., video, audio, and text) to be associated with a session, but
          each protected with an individual security association policy.</t>

          <t>A GAP allows for the distribution of group-wise policy,
          such as instructions for when to activate and de-activate SAs.</t>

          <t>Policies are distributed in substructures to the GSA payload.
          The format of the substructures is defined below in <xref target="gsa_policy" />
          (for GSA policy) and in <xref target="ga_policy" /> (for GA policy).
          The first octet of the substructure unambiguously determines its type -- 
          it is zero for GAP and non-zero (actually, it is a security protocol ID)
          for GSA policies.

            The size of this field is determined by the SPI Size field.
            As described above, these SPIs are assigned by the GCKS. 
            In case of GIKE_REKEY the SPI must be the IKEv2 Header SPI pair where the

            G-IKEv2 rekey message IKEv2 HDR, and the second 8 octets become
            the "Responder's SPI" in the same HDR. When selecting SPI the GCKS
            <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> make sure that the sole first 8 octets (corresponding to "Initiator's SPI" 
            field in the IKEv2 header) uniquely identify the Rekey SA.

            For the Rekey SA (with the GIKE_REKEY protocol) the

            a single IP address, an IP protocol (assumed to be UDP) and a single port the GSA_REKEY messages will be originated from
            or be a wildcard selector. For the Data-Security (AH and ESP) SAs the 
            destination traffic selectors <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> define a single multicast IP address. 
            The source traffic selector in this case <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> define a single IP address or be a wildcard selector.
            IP protocol and ports define the characteristics of traffic protected by this Data-Security SA.
            If the Data-Security SAs are created in tunnel mode, then it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be tunnel mode with address
            preservation (see <xref target="RFC5374" />. UDP encapsulation <xref target="RFC3948" /> 
            is not used for the multicast Data-Security SAs.

            Substructures specifies the policy information for the SA. 
            The format is defined in IKEv2 <xref target="RFC7296"></xref>, section 3.3.2.
            The Last Substruc value in each Transform Substructure

              This specification renames this transform to "Replay Protection (RP)".
              This transform allows to specify whether the 64-bit Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN) are to be used in ESP and AH.

              <t>Since both AH <xref target="RFC4302" /> and ESP <xref target="RFC4303" /> are defined in such a way, 
              that high-order 32 bits of extended sequence numbers are never transmitted, it makes using ESN in multicast Data-Security SAs
              problematic, because GMs that join group long after it is created will have to somehow learn the current high order 32 bits
              of ESN for each sender in the group. The algorithm for doing this described in <xref target="RFC4302" />

              the high-order 32 bits close enough to its real value, which is not the case for multicast SAs. 
              For this reason extended sequence numbers <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used for multicast Data-Security SAs

              <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used in the GSA Payload. The GCKS <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> estimate the data rate and rekey Data-Security SAs freuently enough

            <t>The GAP_ATD attribute (1) allows a GCKS to set the
            Activation Time Delay for Data-Security SAs of the group. The ATD

            should wait after receiving new SAs before staring sending traffic over them.
            Note, that to achieve smooth rollover passive members of the group should
            activate the SAs immediately once they receive them.

            <t>The GAP_DTD attribute (2) allows the GCKS to set the
            Deactivation Time Delay for previously distributed SAs. The
            DTD defines how long after receiving a request to delete Data-Security SAs
            passive group members should wait before actually deleting them.
            Note that active members of the group should stop sending traffic over these old SAs
            once new replacement SAs are activated (after time specified in the GAP_ATD attribute).

            applied as the most significant bits of the IV, as shown in Figure

        Two types of Key Packets are used -- Group Key Packet and Member Key Packet.

          <t>The symmetric keys in G-IKEv2 are never sent in clear.
          They are always encrypted with other keys using the 
          format called Wrapped Key that is shown below (<xref target="key_format" />).
          </t>

          <t>The keys are encrypted using algorithm that is used to 
          encrypt the message the keys are sent in. It means, that in case of unicast
          IKE SA (used for GMs registration and rekeying using GSA_INBAND_REKEY)
          the encryption algorithm will be the one negotiated during the 
          IKE SA establishment, while for a GSA_REKEY message the algorithm will be provided
          by the GCKS in the Encryption Algorithm transform in the GSA payload
          when this multicast SA was being established.
          </t>

          <t>If AEAD mode is used for encryption, then for the purpose
          of key encryption the authentication tag <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used
          (both not calculated and not verified), since the G-IKEv2 provides
          authentication of all its messages. In addition there is no AAD in this case.
          If encryption algorithm requires padding, then the encrypted
          key <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be padded before encryption to have the required size.
          If the encryption algorithm doesn't define the padding content,
          then the following scheme <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used: the Padding bytes 
          are initialized with a series of (unsigned, 1-byte) integer values.
          The first padding byte appended to the plaintext is numbered 1, 
          with subsequent padding bytes making up a monotonically 
          increasing sequence: 1, 2, 3, ....  The length of the padding
          is not transmitted and is implicitly determined, since the length
          of the key is known.

    <section title="Interaction with other IKEv2 Protocol Extensions" anchor="ike_ext" >
      <t>A number of IKEv2 extensions is defined that can be used to extend
      protocol functionality. G-IKEv2 is compatible with most of them.
      In particular, EAP authentication defined in <xref target="RFC7296" /> can be used 
      to establish registration IKE SA, as well as EAP-only authentication <xref target="RFC5998" /> and 
      Secure Password authentication <xref target="RFC6467" />. 
      G-IKEv2 is compatible with and can use IKEv2 Redirect Mechanism <xref target="RFC5685" /> and 
      IKEv2 Session Resumption <xref target="RFC5723"></xref>. 
      G-IKEv2 is also compatible with Multiple Key Exchanges in IKEv2 
      framework, defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-multiple-ke" />.
      </t>

      <t>The above list of compatible IKEv2 extensions is not exhaustive, however some IKEv2 
      extensions require special handling if used in G-IKEv2.
      </t>

      <section title="Mixing Preshared Keys in IKEv2 for Post-quantum Security">
        <t>G-IKEv2 can take advantage of the protection provided by
        Postquantum Preshared Keys (PPK) for IKEv2 <xref
        target="RFC8784"></xref>. However, the use of 
        PPK leaves the initial IKE SA susceptible to quantum
        computer (QC) attacks. While group SA keys are protected with 
        the default KWK (GSK_w), which is derived from SK_d and thus
        cannot be broken even by attacker equipped with a QC, authentication 
        of these keys relies on authentication of IKE SA messages, which is not 
        secure against QC until the initial IKE SA is rekeyed. 
        In additional, the other content of IKE SA messages may also 
        be visible to an attacker with a QC. See Section 6 of <xref target="RFC8784" /> for details.
        </t>

        <t>For these reasons the GCKS <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> send GSA and KD payloads in the GSA_AUTH response message
        and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return a new notification REKEY_IS_NEEDED instead.
        Upon receiving this notification in the GSA_AUTH response
        the GM <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> perform an IKE SA rekey and then initiate a new GSA_REGISTRATION
        request for the same group. Below are possible scenarios involving using PPK.
        </t>

        <t>The GM starts the IKE_SA_INIT exchange requesting using PPK, and the GCKS responds with agreement to do it, 
        or aborts according to its "mandatory_or_not" flag:</t>

    <section anchor="lkh_key_management" title="Use of LKH in G-IKEv2">
      <t>Section 5.4 of <xref target="RFC2627"></xref> describes the LKH
      architecture, and how a GCKS uses LKH to exclude group members. This
      section clarifies how the LKH architecture is used with G-IKEv2.</t>

      <section anchor="lkh_notation" title="Notation">
        <t>In this section we will use the notation X{Y} 
        where a key with ID Y is encrypted with the key with ID X.
        The notation GSK_w{Y} means that the default wrap key GSK_w (with zero KWK ID)is used 
        to encrypt key Y, and the notation X{K_sa} means key X is used 
        to encrypt the SA key K_sa (wich always has zero Key ID). Note, that GSK_w{K_sa} means that
        the SA key is encrypted with the default wrap key, in which case both KWK ID and Key ID are zero.
        For simplicity we will assume that 
        </t>

        <t>The content of the KD payload will be shown as a sequence
        of Key Packets. The Group Key Packet substructure will be denoted as GP(SAn)(),
        when n is an SPI for the SA, and the Member Key Packet substructure
        will be denoted as MP(). The content of the Key Packets 
        is shown as SA_KEY and WRAP_KEY attributes with the notation
        described above. For simplicity the type of the attribute will not be shown,
        because it is implicitly defined by the type of Key Packet.
        </t>

        <t> Here is the example of KD payload.
        <figure align="center">
          <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
KD(GP1(X{K_sa}),MP(Y{X},Z{Y},GSK_w{Z})
          ]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        For simplicity any other attributes in the KD payload are omitted.
        </t>

        <t>We will also use the notation X-&gt;Y-&gt;Z
        to describe the Key Path. In this case key Y is needed to dectypt key X and key Z is needed to decrypt key Y.
        In the example above the keys had the following relation: K_sa-&gt;X-&gt;Y-&gt;Z-&gt;GSK_w.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Group Creation">
        <t>When a GCKS forms a group, it creates a key tree as shown in the
        figure below. The key tree contains logical keys (which are represented as
        the values of their Key IDs in the figure) and a private key shared with only a single GM
        (the GMs are represented as letters followed by the corresponding 
        key ID in parentheses in the figure). The root of the tree contains the
        multicast Rekey SA key (which is represented as SAn(K_san). The figure below assumes that the Key IDs
        are assigned sequentially; this is not a requirement and only used
        for illustrative purposes. The GCKS may create a complete tree as shown, or a partial tree which is
        created on demand as members join the group.

        <t>When GM A joins the group, the GCKS provides it
        with the keys in the KD payload of the GSA_AUTH or
        GSA_REGISTRATION exchange. Given the tree shown in figure above, the
        KD payload will be:

<figure align="center" title="KD Payload for the Group Member A">
  <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
KD(GP(SA1)(1{K_sa1}),MP(3{1},7{3},GSK_w{7})
  ]]></artwork>
</figure>

        From these attributes the GM A will construct 
        the Key Path K_sa1-&gt;1-&gt;3-&gt;7-&gt;GSK_w and since it
        ends up with GSK_w, it will use all the WRAP_KEY attributes 
        present in the path as its Working Key Path: 1-&gt;3-&gt;7.
        </t>

        <t>Similarly, when other GMs will be joining the group they will be provided with the corresponding 
        keys, so after all the GMs will have the following Working Key Paths:
        <figure align="center">
          <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[

        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Simple Group SA Rekey">
        <t>If the GCKS performs a simple SA rekey without changing group membership,
        it will only send Group Key Packet in the KD payload with a new
        SA key encrypted with the default KWK.

        <figure align="center" title="KD Payload for the Simple Group SA Rekey">

KD(GP(SA2)(GSK_w{K_sa2}))

        </figure>

        All the GMs will be able to decrypt it and no changes in their Working Key Paths will happen.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Group Member Exclusion">
        <t>If the GKCS has reason to believe that a GM should be excluded,
        then it can do so by sending a GSA_REKEY message that includes a set
        of GM_KEY attributes which would allow all GMs except for the excluded one 
        to get a new SA key.
        </t>

        <t>In the example below the GCKS excludes GM F. For this purpose
        it changes the key tree as follows, replacing the key 2 with the key 15 and
        the key 5 with the key 16. It also generates a new SA key for a new SA3.
        </t>

        </figure>

        <t>Then it sends the following KD payload for the new Rekey SA3:

        <figure align="center" title="KD Payload for the Group Member F">
          <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[
KD(GP(SA3)(1{K_sa3},15{K_sa3}),MP(6{15},16{15},11{16})

        </figure>

        While processing this KD payload:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>GMs A, B, C and D will be able to decrypt the SA_KEY attribute 1{K_sa3} by using
          the "1" key from their key path. Since no new GM_KEY attributes are in the new 
          Key Path, they won't update their Working Key Paths.
          </t>
          <t>GMs G and H will construct new Key Path 15-&gt;6 and will be able to decrypt
          the intermediate key 15 using the key 6 from their Working Key Paths. So, they will
          update their Working Key Paths replacing their beginnings up to the key 6 
          with the new Key Path (thus replacing the key 2 with the key 15).
          </t>
          <t>GM E will construct new Key Path 16-&gt;15-&gt;11 and will be able to decrypt
          the intermediate key 16 using the key 11 from its Working Key Path. So, it will
          update its Working Key Path replacing its beginnings up to the key 11 
          with the new Key Path (thus replacing the key 2 with the key 15 and the key 5 with the key 16).
          </t>
          <t>GM F won't be able to construct any Key Path leading to any key he possesses,
          so it will be unable to decrypt the new SA key for the SA3 and thus it will be excluded
          from the group once the SA3 is used.
          </t>
        </list>
        </t>

        <t>Finally, the GMs will have the following Working Key Paths:
